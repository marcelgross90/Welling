This repository contains a library for generating Android Applications for the project GeMARA based on [JavaPoet][javapoet].

Introduction:
------------

After the application is generated you must alter the permission for `gradlew`:
    
    $ chmod 777 gradlew
 
Alternatively you can use the `Makefile` to build and install the generated app:

    $ make
